# test-frontend
This project was created from VueCLI, using Vue 3.

It is powered by 3 components, and a central Data Service to make API calls. 

Apart from that, RDKit-JS has also been implemneted as a raw JavaScript library, and making direct calls to it.

By default pagination limit is set to 10, with buttons to navigate across pages.

The template is very minimalistic and just viewing the data in a structured format.
